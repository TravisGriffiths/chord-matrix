Chord Matrix
===============

This is a table replacement for a chord graph in a modified table/bar form. The core issue is that many individuals have
difficulties in reading chord graphs. Chord graphs are used to show a many to many relationship between a set of
different items. This is usually directional, as in A implies (leads to) B. The original use of these graphs was in
genetics to show how the expression of a gene (A) would subsequently cause the expression of a different gene (B).
This has since lead to many other uses, taxi rides from neighborhood A to B to map ridership for a city, the purchase
of product A leading to the subsequent purchase of B etc. Ultimately, for any arc set in a chord graph, each item
could itself be graphed more simply as a bar graph showing the relationship between that single item and the other
items in the set. For a typical chord graph this means turning a single graphic into a half dozen or more simpler
charts, which trades simplicity for an increase in chart number and screen real estate by an order of magnitude.
  The central issue however remains the same, many people can easily read 6+ bar graphs, but cannot read
a chord graph containing the same data. This project attempt to use simpler graphs and a few active elements to
simplify the visualization, while maintaining the general compact density of the original chord graphic.
